SockBot 2.0
===========
Sockbot - A rebuild of a sock puppet robot worthy of TheDailyWTF in EcmaScript 6.

Developers

SockBot is designed for educational purposes, and is not intended to be used on typical production forums. It is also 
designed as an experiment of what can be automated within Discourse, and is generally targeted directly at 
what.thedailywtf.com.

This bot should not be used without the forum owners consent, and any use of this bot should be immediately 
discontinued at the request of the forum owners or moderators. SockBot is not intended for any ill purposes, and the 
designers of SockBot can not be held liable for abuses of the technology, or any software derived from it.
